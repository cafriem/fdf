# fdf

*Running The Program* 

In order to run, type the following:

"make"
wait for the program to finish compiling
"./fdf test_maps/t1.fdf"

if you want to run any other map, then typein "./fdf test_maps/<map name>"
the map names are inside of the 'folder test_maps' so just type in the name and run the program.



*Making your own map* 
  
If you want to make or create your own maps then make a new file and copy the format that is in other maps like spaces and commas.
If you want to add color, then use maps like t1.fdf as referance. They use the hex code to identify the color.
